Multilayer perceptron in C
==========================

Backpropagation training of a two-layer perceptron neural network in pure C. I wrote this as part of a class on "Learning and Reasoning Systems" in 2007. The purpose of the project was to investigate what is the optimal number of hidden units for a given classification problem.

The network learns to classify 5x7 images representing letters of the alphabet and numbers. The images are corrupted by noise and the performance of the network is evaluated using cross-validation.
